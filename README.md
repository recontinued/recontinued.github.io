## recontinued

recountinued is a project that was founded in 2022.
The aim is to develop on projects that are no longer continued.  

Through this we want to build a place for people to use the librarys they want. We are not filling the libraries with mainly new functions, but we will performing security-relevant updates and bug fixes.

## I have a library that is no longer maintained, can I suggest it anywhere?
Yes you can! Head over to [recontinued/recontinued](https://github.com/recontinued/recontinued/issues) and make a new issue.
